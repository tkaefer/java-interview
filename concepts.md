# Microservices
   ## Decomposition
     - Decompose by business capability
     - Decompose by subdomain
     - Self-contained Service
     - Service per team
   ## Refactoring to microservices
     - Strangler Application
     - Anti-corruption layer
   ## Data management
     - Database per Service
     - Shared database
     - Saga
     - API Composition
     - CQRS
     - Domain event
     - Event sourcing
   ## Transactional messaging
     - Transactional outbox
     - Transaction log tailing
     - Polling publisher
   ## Testing
     - Service Component Test
     - Consumer-driven contract test
     - Consumer-side contract test
   ## Deployment patterns
     - Multiple service instances per host
     - Service instance per host
     - Service instance per VM
     - Service instance per Container
     - Serverless deployment
     - Service deployment platform
   ## Cross cutting concerns
     - Microservice chassis
     - Service Template
     - Externalized configuration
   ## Communication style
     - Remote Procedure Invocation
     - Messaging
     - Domain-specific protocol
     - Idempotent Consumer
   ## External API
     - API gateway
     - Backend for front-end
   ## Service discovery
     - Client-side discovery
     - Server-side discovery
     - Service registry
     - Self registration
     - 3rd party registration
   ## Reliability
     - Circuit Breaker
   ## Security
     - Access Token
   ## Observability
     - Log aggregation
     - Application metrics
     - Audit logging
     - Distributed tracing
     - Exception tracking
     - Health check API
     - Log deployments and changes
   ## UI patterns
     - Server-side page fragment composition
